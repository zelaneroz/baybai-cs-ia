# CS IA | Baybai: a Baybayin script learning app


# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition
Baybayin (ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔) is one of the pre-colonial writing systems used by early Filipinos as the writing component of Tagalog (the national language of the Philippines). More than three centuries of Spanish colonization led to the replacement of Baybayin by the Latin alphabet. Up to this date, there’s only less than 1% of the population that can read or write Baybayin[1].

A Tagalog language teacher from a public high school in the Philippines aims to revive the ancient script and teach it to his students. Recognizing the prevalence of mobile phones among students, a dedicated app becomes crucial for out-of-class learning. The teacher would like an application that enhances memory recall and knowledge reinforcement through visual cues and active engagement. Thus, a flashcard-based learning environment and the option to save words or flashcards for later memorization will be utilized. The teacher would also like to track students’ consistency by setting custom daily learning goals, necessitating a feature to set and monitor users' flashcard reading targets for consistent learning. To address the challenge of individualized progress tracking in a shared learning environment, the app incorporates a secure login system. Anticipating students' struggle with real-world application due to Baybayin's limited usage and the absence of comprehensive references, the app includes a robust translator feature. Since there is no accessible Baybayin keyboard for students, the app enables users to copy translated text to their clipboard, ensuring practical use beyond the classroom. Furthermore, fostering a sense of community and collaborative learning, the app incorporates a social platform where users can interact, share insights, and collectively enhance their Baybayin proficiency.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution to address the challenges faced by the teacher and students in learning Baybayin is a mobile application called 'Baybai'. The application gets it name from the root word of 'Baybayin' which is 'baybay' meaning 'to spell' and 'bai' a Filipino expression which means friend. 'Baybai' is designed to provide an accessible and engaging platform for learning the Baybayin script. Developed using Python and KivyMD and the database handled using SQLite, the app allows students to conveniently learn and practice Baybayin outside the classroom. It offers a comprehensive learning experience with flashcards. The app includes a translator feature that allows users to easily translate Tagalog words and phrases into Baybayin characters, facilitating practical application in real-life contexts. Furthermore, 'baybai' tracks and measures students' progress through a daily goal count, motivating them to strive for continuous improvement. With its user-friendly interface, comprehensive learning resources, and focus on consistency and growth, 'baybai' empowers students to revive and master the Baybayin script effectively.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution

**Mobile Application**
* Accessibility: According to the problem definition, mobile phones are the more prevalent and accessible gadgets among the client’s students. Mobile phones can also be accessed anytime, anywhere making it an on-the-go learning aid.

**Flashcards-Based Learning**
* Effective Learning Technique: Flashcards are known for their effectiveness in promoting active recall and spaced repetition, aiding in long-term retention and comprehension[^2]. 
* Visual and Engaging: Flashcards provide visual cues, helping students associate Baybayin characters with their meanings, making the learning process more engaging and memorable[^2].

**Python and Kivy**
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python, a versatile programming language, along with Kivy, a Python framework, allows for the development of cross-platform mobile applications, ensuring compatibility across various operating systems[^3],[^4].

**PyCharm**
* Python-Specific Support: PyCharm offers dedicated support for Python development, including syntax highlighting, code analysis, and refactoring tools, which contribute to the smooth development process and code quality[^5].

**SQLite**
* Efficient and Reliable: SQLite offers high-performance data storage and retrieval capabilities, ensuring smooth data management within the mobile application, including user progress tracking and storing translation data[^6].

## Design Statement
I will design and make a mobile application for a client who is a Tagalog teacher at a public high school in the Philippines. The application will allow users to learn Baybayin and have four main functionalities: flashcards, translator, save flashcards, and an online forum. It will be developed using the Python programming language, KivyMD, and the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment. It will take 12 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the following success criteria.
