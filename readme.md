# CS IA | Baybai: a Baybayin script learning app


# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition
Baybayin (ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔) is one of the precolonial writing systems used by early Filipinos as the writing component of Tagalog (national language). More than three centuries of Spanish colonization led to the replacement of Baybayin by the Latin alphabet.

A teacher in a public high school in the Philippines teaching Tagalog, wants to help revive Baybayin by teaching the script to his students. Internet and desktop access is difficult for his students given the costs that come with mobile data plans, Wi-Fi, and laptops.  It's also difficult for students to remember the script outside of a classroom setting given that Baybayin is not used by anyone outside of a certain niche. With this, it's important for students to have a translator to apply the script in real-life context. To add, like learning any language, consistent practice is crucial and practice should involve writing and memorizing characters. 

## Success Criteria
1. The solution is a mobile application that's accessible offline and provides a way for users to learn Baybayin using flashcards based on spaced repetition.
2. The application has three modalities: learning mode, test mode, and translator.
3The app keeps track of the user's streaks and highest user streak to encourage consistency.
4. The flashcards for learning mode enable writing/stroke practice and shows Baybayin characters and its corresponding Tagalog translation.
5. 'Test mode' of the application tests the user by generating random Tagalog words and allowing the user to type in the corresponding Baybayin script. The user's scores will be recorded and presented visually.
6. The app enables Tagalog to Baybayin translation and allows the user to copy the Baybayin characters to their clipboard.
